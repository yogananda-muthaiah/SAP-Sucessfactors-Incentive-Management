The connection between SAP Datasphere and SAP SuccessFactors Incentive Management is made through the SAP Cloud Connector.

SAP manages the SAP Cloud Connector used in this scenario. It is the integration point between Customer's SAP Datasphere BTP Subaccount and the SAP HANA Database used for SAP SuccessFactors Incentive Management.

As SAP manages the SAP Cloud Connector and the SAP HANA Database, and Customer manages the Customer's SAP Datasphere BTP Subaccount, the cooperation between SAP and Customer plays an important role in the connection procedure.

The connection procedure, in summary, consists of a customer opening an SAP Support Case and requesting this connection. SAP will internally set up a SAP Cloud Connector, connecting it to the corresponding SAP HANA Database, and - in cooperation with Customer - connecting the SAP Cloud Connector with the SAP Datasphere BTP Subaccount.
